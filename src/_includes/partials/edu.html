                                Under my Studies, there are 4 game projects with 15+ people per team, ranging
                                between 3-7 weeks, and a 6-month LIA.

                                Under the game projects, I have learned how important communication is for

                                Making systems that are easy to use and heavily customizable is important when
                                is mostly that others in a team are using them.
