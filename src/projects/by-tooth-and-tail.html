                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    By Tooth & Tail is a 3D top down, grid-based stealth game where the player is playing as a failed experiment rat
                    that is trying to find the dagger plaid. Inspired by the pokemon dungeons movement, in our game whenever the player
                    moves or does an action that counts as a turn move, makes the enemy make a turn move. There are interactables used
                    for distracting enemies, making them move in its direction, and hiding spots used for stealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked primarily on the turn based system, interactables, specific tiles for the grid and their effects, helping
                    implement Ui and porting the game to mobile.

                <h3>What I learned </h3>
                <p>
                    For this project I got the unfortunate experience of having friction in the team to the point where the quality of
                    the game got impacted. From this experience I learned some important things to do and keep in mind when dealing with
                    these kinds of situations. Being calm under undesirable situations is super important, bringing negative emotions
                    does not help the situation, staging calm even walking away from the situation for a movement can be super important
                    when later the situation needs to be addressed. Bringing in other neutral people in the conversation when things
                    need to be meditated is very helpful to put things into perspective for both parties and that the conversation stays
                    civil and does not become heated. Keeping self motivation up, wanting to continue working on a project and wanting
                    to fix friction in the team is super important, so work doesn't get hindered by a lack of motivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned how important communication is especially when working remotely, so communication does not get missed or
                    wrongly interpreted in the team, and being updated on what is happening in the project, on what is getting worked
                    on, what is done and what needs to get done. Jira has been super helpful in this front to keep track of what is
                    happening in the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got better at estimating and planning for deadlines for features, so the team can more easily plan around when my
                    work will be done. If I went over the estimated time I was able to communicate that I need more time and give a new
                    estimate of when a feature would be done.
