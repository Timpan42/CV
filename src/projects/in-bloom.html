        <h2>AI</h2>
        <p>The enemy AI uses Unreal's <b>Behavior Tree</b> and <b>AI controller</b> in combination with <b>task
                nodes</b> and a <b>Blackboard</b> to
            create the enemies behavior. It also has a <b>AI Perception </b> component for seeing and hearing noises the
            player makes. The AI has
            stated It can be in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Idle; Standing in one place looking around waiting for a new event to execute a different behavior.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol; Moving around to different locations depending on what patrol pattern is attached.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Alerted; Moves to the last known location of a sensation trigger.
                    Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the player
                    it
                    attacks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Attack; The enemy attacks doing an attack animation and a collision check to see if it hits, if it
                    does the
                    player takes damage, if the player moves out of range during the attack nothing happens.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The AI is editable per enemy so it can have different behaviors making it possible to have different scenarios and
            challenges for the player. There are four patrol behaviors
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    No Patrolling; The Ai doesn't move from its spawn position.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol points in order; Follows a fixed route based on patrol points.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol points random; Randomly chooses a patrol point it can go to.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    True random: Randomly chooses a point in the navigation mesh it in and goes to it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A normal sequence for the Ai would be, moving around based on its patrol behavior, if it gets a sensation trigger
            change to Alerted state. If it spots the player change to Chase state. When it loses sight of the player, change
            Alerted state and if it can not see the player there change to Patrol state.
