                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Primarily worked on AI, combat and UI programming. Used Unreal's behavior tree for the AI, made sure that the enemy
                    worked with the main combat mechanic, worked with the UI team to implement and connect UI with gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I go in to more detail on how the AI works, using states to manage behavior.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Got better
                    at managing time with a lot of takes and a short deadline, taking ownership of features, and communicating in a
                    team.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My three main working aries were AI and combat programming - anything related to the enemy in the
                    game
                    was my
                    responsibility to program, and UI programming - helping the UI team implement their UI and any
                    features
                    that they
                    needed was my responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>The AI uses Unreal's behavior tree and states for determining behavior, combining the AI controller
                    and
                    task nodes to
                    execute behavior. We used unreal's third person character as a base for movement, saving time on not
                    making our own
                    character controller.

                    For combat I made sure that the enemy worked with the main combat mechanic in the game and that the
                    enemies were
                    easily balanceable without modifying code.
                    For UI I worked together with the UI team making the UI work, setting up connections between what is
                    happening in the
                    game with the UI. I worked on the main- and pause menu, making settings and navigation consistent
                    and
                    working.
                </p>
                <p>I spent most of my time programming in blueprints mostly because it was fast to prototype features,
                    and
                    so others in
                    the team had the possibility to edit and understand the code base, especially if they didn't have
                    experience working
                    in C++.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h3>AI</h3>
                <p>The enemy AI uses Unreal's <b>Behavior Tree</b> and <b>AI controller</b> in combination with <b>task
                        nodes</b> and a <b>Blackboard</b> to
                    create the enemies behavior. It also has a <b>AI Perception </b> component for seeing and hearing
                    noises
                    the
                    player makes. The AI has
                    stated It can be in:
                </p>
                <div class="project-side-by-side">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Idle; Standing in one place looking around waiting for a new event to execute a different
                            behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Patrol; Moving around to different locations depending on what patrol pattern is attached.

                    <p>
                        Alerted; Moves to the last known location of a sensation trigger.
                        Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the
                        player
                        it
                        attacks.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-side-by-side">
                    <p>
                        Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the
                        player it attacks.
                    </p>

                        alt="">
                    <p>
                        Attack; The enemy attacks doing an attack animation and a collision check to see if it hits,
                        if
                        it
                        does the
                        player takes damage, if the player moves out of range during the attack nothing happens.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The AI is editable per enemy so it can have different behaviors making it possible to have different
                    scenarios and
                    challenges for the player. There are four patrol behaviors:
                </p>
                <p>
                    No Patrolling; The Ai doesn't move from its spawn position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patrol points in order; Follows a fixed route based on patrol points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patrol points random; Randomly chooses a patrol point it can go to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    True random: Randomly chooses a point in the navigation mesh it in and goes to it.
                </p>
                <p>A normal sequence for the Ai would be, moving around based on its patrol behavior, if it gets a
                    sensation
                    trigger
                    change to Alerted state. If it spots the player change to Chase state. When it loses sight of the
                    player,
                    change
                    Alerted state and if it can not see the player there change to Patrol state.
                </p>

                <h3>What I learned </h3>
                <p>
                    Working on this project I learned how to manage time more efficiently, I often needed to juggle multiple tasks at
                    the same time when having similar deadlines. I needed to prioritize features for each deadline very carefully so I
                    didn't spend too much time on one thing, so the experience of the whole game is better.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Learning Unreal and their AI systems, when I don't have much experience working in Unreal or with AI npcs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Getting better at taking ownership of a feature that I am working on in a team environment, making sure that the
                    feature is up to the standard with the project and so it gets done in time as agreed by the team.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Being better at voicing my opinion in the team, being able to bring up concerns, and coming to a consensus on how
                    features should operate.
