                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                    Lorem Ipsum.

            <h2>AI</h2>
        <p>The enemy AI uses Unreal's <b>Behavior Tree</b> and <b>AI controller</b> in combination with <b>task
                nodes</b> and a <b>Blackboard</b> to
            create the enemies behavior. It also has a <b>AI Perception </b> component for seeing and hearing noises the
            player makes. The AI has
            stated It can be in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Idle; Standing in one place looking around waiting for a new event to execute a different behavior.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol; Moving around to different locations depending on what patrol pattern is attached.
                </p>
                <img class="center project-single-img" src="/images/{{ cardItem.imageFileRoute }}/patrol-ai-tree.webp" alt="">
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Alerted; Moves to the last known location of a sensation trigger.
                    Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the player
                    it
                    attacks.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the player it attacks.
                </p>
                <img class="project-single-img" src="/images/{{ cardItem.imageFileRoute }}/chase-code.webp" alt="">
            
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Attack; The enemy attacks doing an attack animation and a collision check to see if it hits, if it
                    does the
                    player takes damage, if the player moves out of range during the attack nothing happens.
                </p>
                <img class="project-single-img" src="/images/{{ cardItem.imageFileRoute }}/attack-ai-tree.webp" alt="">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The AI is editable per enemy so it can have different behaviors making it possible to have different
            scenarios and
            challenges for the player. There are four patrol behaviors
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    No Patrolling; The Ai doesn't move from its spawn position.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol points in order; Follows a fixed route based on patrol points.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Patrol points random; Randomly chooses a patrol point it can go to.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    True random: Randomly chooses a point in the navigation mesh it in and goes to it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A normal sequence for the Ai would be, moving around based on its patrol behavior, if it gets a sensation
            trigger
            change to Alerted state. If it spots the player change to Chase state. When it loses sight of the player,
            change
            Alerted state and if it can not see the player there change to Patrol state.
