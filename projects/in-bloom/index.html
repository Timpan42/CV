                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it
                    to make a
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including
                    versions of
                    Lorem Ipsum.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My three main working aries were AI and combat programming - anything related to the enemy in the
                    game
                    was my
                    responsibility to program, and UI programming - helping the UI team implement their UI and any
                    feathers
                    that they
                    needed was my responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>The AI uses Unreal's behavior tree and states for determining behavior, combining the AI controller
                    and
                    task nodes to
                    execute behavior. We used unreal's third person character as a base for movement, saving time on not
                    making our own
                    character controller.

                    For combat I made sure that the enemy worked with the main combat mechanic in the game and that the
                    enemies were
                    easily balanceable without modifying code.
                    For UI I worked together with the UI team making the UI work, setting up connections between what is
                    happening in the
                    game with the UI. I worked on the main- and pause menu, making settings and navigation consistent
                    and
                    working.
                </p>
                <p>I spent most of my time programming in blueprints mostly because it was fast to prototype feathers,
                    and
                    so others in
                    the team had the possibility to edit and understand the code base, especially if they didn't have
                    experience working
                    in C++.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="project-content-background project-text-padding">
                <h2>AI</h2>
                <p>The enemy AI uses Unreal's <b>Behavior Tree</b> and <b>AI controller</b> in combination with <b>task
                        nodes</b> and a <b>Blackboard</b> to
                    create the enemies behavior. It also has a <b>AI Perception </b> component for seeing and hearing
                    noises
                    the
                    player makes. The AI has
                    stated It can be in:
                </p>
                <div class="project-side-by-side">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Idle; Standing in one place looking around waiting for a new event to execute a different
                            behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Patrol; Moving around to different locations depending on what patrol pattern is attached.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <img class="center project-single-img" src="/CV/images/project_img/in-bloom/patrol-ai-tree.webp" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="project-side-by-side" data-layout="column-reverse">
                    <img class="project-single-img" src="/CV/images/project_img/in-bloom/alerted-ai-tree.webp" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Alerted; Moves to the last known location of a sensation trigger.
                        Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the
                        player
                        it
                        attacks.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-side-by-side">
                    <p>
                        Chase; Chases the player if the player is in its seeing range, when it's close enough to the
                        player it attacks.
                    </p>

                <div class="project-side-by-side" data-layout="column-reverse">

                    <p>
                        Attack; The enemy attacks doing an attack animation and a collision check to see if it hits,
                        if
                        it
                        does the
                        player takes damage, if the player moves out of range during the attack nothing happens.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The AI is editable per enemy so it can have different behaviors making it possible to have different
                    scenarios and
                    challenges for the player. There are four patrol behaviors:
                </p>
                <p>
                    No Patrolling; The Ai doesn't move from its spawn position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patrol points in order; Follows a fixed route based on patrol points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patrol points random; Randomly chooses a patrol point it can go to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    True random: Randomly chooses a point in the navigation mesh it in and goes to it.
                </p>
                <p>A normal sequence for the Ai would be, moving around based on its patrol behavior, if it gets a
                    sensation
                    trigger
                    change to Alerted state. If it spots the player change to Chase state. When it loses sight of the
                    player,
                    change
                    Alerted state and if it can not see the player there change to Patrol state.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Tim Fagerdal, a <b>game programmer</b> from northern Sweden, living in Vännäs.
                    Currently
                    a game programming student at <b>FutureGames, Umeå</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love playing games, and I want others to get the <b>same feeling</b> from the games I've
                    been a part of, and I find it super satisfying to <b>solve problems</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the world of video games, I like to listen to music, mainly deathcore and
                    metalcore. <b>Lorna Shore's</b> "Pain Remains" album is amazing, and <b>Kardashev</b> is
                    also one of my favorite bands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to <b>exercise</b>, mostly jogging and weight training, finding it rewarding but
                    tuff, and I also like to <b>sing</b> sometimes, even if I'm not that good at it.
