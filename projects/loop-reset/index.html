                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Loop reset is a roguelike twin-stick shooter with an arcade feel and a sci-fi theme. I primarily
                    worked on the level
                    generator, working with the level designer to have cohesive, playable levels. Other responsibilities
                    were game saving,
                    performance handling, game setup sequences, and making builds of the game. After the problems faced
                    because of technical
                    debt, I learned the importance of planning code bases that will be used and how systems would need
                    to scale.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Loop reset is a rogue-like, twin stick shooter where the player needs to survive a horde of aliens
                    and
                    continually
                    move forward through procedurally generated levels. By using weapons, gadgets, and elemental
                    effects, the
                    player
                    defeats enemies who are constantly getting stronger. Levels can have special objectives that impose
                    challenges that
                    need to be conquered before moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this project, my prime responsibilities were level generation - working closely with the
                    project's level
                    designers to make levels feel natural and have a good gameplay flow, both having intense sections
                    and calmer
                    sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other responsibilities I had were: Game saving - handling save data that is being used between
                    levels, for
                    example,
                    weapon upgrades, player current stats, etc. This also included saving to files and handling high
                    scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Performance handler - making sure that the performance of the game is good and doesn't go lower than
                    an
                    acceptable
                    level, fixing areas where performance is noticeably worse than others. Changing Unreal settings to
                    exclude
                    features
                    that were not needed or used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game setup sequence - controlling how the game loads its level, making sure systems are done
                    initialising
                    before
                    moving to the main gameplay level. This is to prevent game-breaking bugs, for example, levels not
                    being
                    loaded,
                    making it impossible to progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making builds - I was in charge of making builds and making sure that they worked as intended.

                <h3>Level Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    In Loop Reset, we have procedural level generation, which uses rooms that have level instances
                    attached to them
                    that
                    get placed in the world one after another, in the end creating a level. Rooms have different sizes
                    and different
                    purposes. For example, a combat room is usually bigger and holds a lot more enemies and is designed
                    to be more
                    intense, while a corridor room is smaller in size and is designed to be calmer. I worked closely
                    with level
                    designers, mapping out how rooms would be placed and what a whole level would look like.
                    The flow of levels was important to consider when building the level generator, having sections with
                    high
                    intensity
                    but also areas that are calmer just after an intense moment.
                    We worked back and forth, having a lot of conversations about what was wanted from the level
                    generator and what
                    was
                    needed. Throughout the project, I controlled the production flow for rooms, keeping track of what
                    type of rooms
                    were
                    needed and setting deadlines for them. This was so that rooms were done in a reasonable time, and
                    also so rooms
                    were
                    not over-scoped and would work with the level generator.
                </p>

                    <h4>

                    <p>
                        A Room is an Actor that holds the size of the room in the form of a collider, and the direction
                        of it, including
                        an entering point and exit points. All meshes and any special mechanics that are connected to a
                        room are kept in
                        a level instance that gets loaded in when the level generator can confirm that it has finished
                        making a level.

                        <p>
                            How the level generator works is first choosing which order rooms will spawn in, with some
                            weighted randomness, a room
                            type gets chosen - a room type being an Enum class. The chosen room type gets placed in an
                            array that's going to be used
                            later for spawning room Actors. The weighted randomness gives control over level flow when
                            generating.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Room spawning</h4>
                        <p>
                            When generating rooms, the generator goes through the room type array that was generated
                            beforehand,
                            spawning rooms that are correlated to the room type and placing them on the edge of any exit
                            points from the
                            previous room. When a room spawns, we check if it collides with other rooms to make sure
                            that rooms aren't
                            overlapping. If the recently spawned room collides with another room, we delete the spawned
                            room and try
                            again with another room piece. If a room piece is valid, we collect any exit points from the
                            room, they get
                            used for the next spawning room. The generator continually repeats these actions, going
                            through the room
                            type array until it's empty.
                        </p>

                </div>

                <div class="project-side-by-side">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Special rooms spawning</h4>
                        <p>
                            Special rooms are single offshoot rooms that can be connected to normal rooms that have exit
                            points to hold them. They
                            hold different events that are contained and designed to promote exploration. To make sure
                            that special rooms do not
                            interfere with the normal room spawning, they are done after the normal spawning is
                            complete. Spawning works the same as
                            the “Room spawning” section, but with the added caveat that if a special room spawns and it
                            collides with another room,
                            the spawned room gets removed and gets replaced with a wall, closing the possibility of
                            moving that direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When every room is placed and the map is done generating, without failing, we load all level
                            instances for the rooms and
                            wait for them to load before completing the level generator. We use level instances to save
                            on loading times, only
                            loading assets when we have a working level, and to make it easier for the level designer to
                            make levels, not being
                            restricted by building them in blueprints.

                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        <p>
                            When making the level generator, it was easy to make rooms spawn and check if placements
                            were valid. I struggled with
                            figuring out how to control the randomisation with the system I had, because the world map
                            isn't built on a grid, and
                            rooms don't have any standardized measurements. We also wanted the map to be linear, having
                            a clear direction to move
                            and no big branching paths that the player could walk through. Why we wanted control over
                            how levels were generated was
                            to get control over the game and level flow, having areas that are intense and calmer areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The solution to have control over the generation was to have an Enum array of room types,
                            which gets filled by weighted
                            randomisation. By categorizing room types into two groups: Aggressive rooms - larger rooms
                            with combat, and passive
                            rooms, and passive rooms - calmer sections where almost no combat happens, I could then
                            track how the level flow would
                            be. By tracking which group the latest room type belonged to, I could weigh the choice for
                            the level selector. For
                            example, if the generator had added two passive room types, for the next room it could
                            choose, there were 80% chances
                            for an aggressive room to spawn, instead of the default 40%. This worked the same if there
                            were multiple aggressive room
                            types that were spawned, but with different percentile values. This gave more control over
                            the generation, so there were
                            no long stretches of the level where nothing happened or too much happened.

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I had a great team and working environment, and we were driven throughout the
                    project. We did have
                    problems with technical debt; the code base at the beginning of the project was not the best, making
                    it hard to work
                    with. Debugging and bugfixing were particularly difficult; on many occasions, values that would be
                    used to change stats
                    didn't work as intended, which made it hard to find and fix problems inside the code base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fixing the code base at the beginning of the project would save a lot of time and work for all
                    involved in the project.
                    Code that worked at the beginning was never really future-proofed or planned to be expanded on,
                    which caused problems
                    later on when it needed to be expanded. With the short period of the project, we didn’t have time to
                    fix problematic
                    portions of the code base. If the code didn't have critical problems, it was kept and not changed,
                    which made technical
                    debt problematic. From this situation, I learned the importance of planning out the code bases
                    before committing to
                    writing it, and the importance of planning how a system would scale when more features are added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned the importance of having someone in the team who can set deadlines for content; in
                    this project, it was
                    partly my role. Because of the limited time of the project, we needed internal deadlines for
                    features and content pieces
                    to make sure that we had the time to make everything that we wanted to be in the game. With the
                    deadlines, we could plan
                    better for what was possible with the time we had, making the work experience more enjoyable with
                    less stress through
                    the project.

                    Hello, I'm Tim Fagerdal, a <b>game programmer</b> from northern Sweden, living in Vännäs.
                    Currently
                    a game programming student at <b>FutureGames, Umeå</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love playing games, and I want others to get the <b>same feeling</b> from the games I've
                    been a part of, and I find it super satisfying to <b>solve problems</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the world of video games, I like to listen to music, mainly deathcore and
                    metalcore. <b>Lorna Shore's</b> "Pain Remains" album is amazing, and <b>Kardashev</b> is
                    also one of my favorite bands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to <b>exercise</b>, mostly jogging and weight training, finding it rewarding but
                    tuff, and I also like to <b>sing</b> sometimes, even if I'm not that good at it.
                </p>
